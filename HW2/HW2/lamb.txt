Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, 
Little lamb, Mary had a little lamb, 
Its fleece was white as snow. 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
Mary went, Mary went, 
Everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb wasn't  sure to go. 
It followed her to school one day, 
School one day, school one day, 
It followed her to school one day, 
Which was against the rule. 
it made the children laugh and play, 
Laugh and play, laugh and play. 
it made the children laugh and play 
To see a lamb at school.
